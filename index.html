          <h2>Our Impact</h2>
          <p>Our foundational work involves the development and administration of national First Nations survey initiatives.
             These include:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>The First Nations Regional Health Survey (FNRHS)</li>
              <li>The First Nations Regional Early Childhood, Education, and Employment Survey (FNREEES)</li>
              <li>The First Nations Labour and Employment Development (FNLED) survey</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These surveys have significantly contributed to closing the data gap for First Nations communities over the past two decades. The data has been instrumental in the development of key community health programs, such as:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>The Aboriginal Diabetes Initiative</li>
              <li>The Aboriginal Head Start Program on Reserve</li>
              <li>The Children’s Oral Health Initiative</li>
              <li>The Maternal Child Health Program</li>
              <li>The National Aboriginal Youth Suicide Prevention program</li>
          </ul>

                In the 2016 census, 40,880 people identified as having Algonquin ancestry. 

                The Algonquin language, also known as Omàmiwininìmowin, is part of the Algonquian language family.
